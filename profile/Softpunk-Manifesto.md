# Softpunk

A technological movement for legitimate, traceable software—free of simulacra.

---

## 1. CORE PRINCIPLES

Softpunk is not an aesthetic, nor nostalgia. It is an ethics of implementation.

It demands software that is:
- Secure  
- Transparent  
- Traceable  

It rejects:
- The spectacle of progress without substance  
- Structural dependency as default  
- Functional opacity  

Softpunk does not seek compatibility with legacy systems,  
but functional legitimacy from first principles.

## 2. KEY POLICIES

### → Radical Portability  
Every program must be semi-portable, portable, or self-contained.  
Minimal dependencies. System access restricted to functional necessity.

### → Accessible Security  
All security features must be available to the end user.  
Clear interfaces. No unnecessary technical jargon.

### → Traceable Code Clarity  
Code must be polished, readable, and auditable.  
No sentimentality. No ornamentation.

### → Ethical Notification of Modifications  
Any modification to source code (regardless of license)  
must be notified to the original author.  
Structural respect. Openness to mutual improvement.

### → Optional and Comprehensible Telemetry  
Tracking or telemetry functions must always be optional.  
Clear explanations. Informed consent.

### → Implementation Before Innovation  
Technology must be implemented in its best possible form  
before layering new features or innovations.  
No accumulation without foundational consolidation.

### → Universal, Free, and Replicable Standards  
Technology must be based on open, replicable, and auditable standards.  
If no standard exists, it may be designed and submitted for public discourse  
until it finds legitimate form.

## 3. ARCHIVAL ETHICS

Every technical and ethical decision must be documented.

Every line of code, interface, and policy is part of an auditable archive.  
The purpose must be reconstructible—not just the function.
