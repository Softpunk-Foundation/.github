# SOFTPUNK LICENSE (SPL)  
*Ethical–Legal Addendum to Permissive Licenses*  
Copyright (c) [Year] [Author]

### 1. Scope and Purpose
This License supplements an existing permissive license (MIT, BSD, Apache, or equivalent). It introduces obligations to ensure traceability and documentation of modifications when the Software is incorporated into proprietary products. The intent is to prevent silent privatization of modifications while respecting institutional reservation and proprietary licensing.

### 2. Grant of Rights
Subject to the terms of the underlying permissive license and this Addendum, permission is granted to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software.

### 3. Notification of Modifications
The obligations of notification apply only to modifications incorporated into proprietary products at the time of their release to the market. Forks, redistributions, or modifications published under open source or copyleft licenses are exempt.  

Notification shall consist of delivering documentation of the modifications to the original author, either by:  
- Electronic mail with attached documents;  
- Physical mail with attached documents; or  
- Publication in a publicly accessible repository or archive.  

Proof of delivery or publication shall constitute compliance.

### 4. Documentation Requirement
The Licensee must prepare and retain documentation sufficient to enable a third party to:  
- Understand the scope and purpose of the modification;  
- Reproduce the modification based on the documentation provided.  

### 5. Proprietary Integration
Where the Software is incorporated into a proprietary product:  
- Documentation of modifications must be provided to the original author or made publicly accessible;  
- A non‑disclosure agreement (NDA) may be used to protect sensitive information, provided that such NDA does not prevent the technical understanding of the improvements.  

Once notification and documentation obligations have been fulfilled, the proprietary product remains fully subject to its own license, patents, and institutional jurisdiction.

### 6. Preservation of Change History
All modifications must be recorded in a manner that ensures the history of changes remains traceable and auditable, even if the modified code is not made public.

### 7. Non‑Exclusivity
No exclusivity is granted over modifications. Any party may use the documented modifications to develop their own implementations.

### 8. Relationship with Base License
In the event of conflict between the base license and this Addendum, the provisions concerning traceability and documentation shall prevail, without affecting patent clauses, disclaimers, or liability limitations of the base license.

### 9. Acceptance
Use, copying, modification, or distribution of the Software constitutes acceptance of this License.
