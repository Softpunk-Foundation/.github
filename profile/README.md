The **Softpunk Foundation** is an independent technical entity.

This foundation operates under its own principles, workflows, and symbolic grammar.

- **Existential Legitimacy**: Every operator, interface, and artifact must be structurally justified and auditable.
- **Reversibility**: All workflows must be reversible without loss of state or meaning.
- **Autonomy**: No dependency on implicit context, platform-specific hacks, or privilege escalation.
- **Symbolic Hygiene**: Naming, branding, and iconography must be original, non-confusable, and free of accidental meaning.
- **Traceable Documentation**: Every decision—technical or ethical—is documented for public audit and reproducibility.

  Any modification to external code must be transparently documented and, where possible, communicated to the original author.
